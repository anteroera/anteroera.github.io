<!-- SNOWBOARDING TEXT 1 !-->

			<H4 style="font-size: 21px; padding-top:0%;"><small>Actually, snowboarding has become more of a lifestyle than just a hobby for me during the past year and I've met many important friends while snowboarding. I started snowboarding shortly after I joined <a href="http://www.skipoli.fi">Skipoli</a>, which is a skiing/snowboarding club at my home university, and immediately fell in love with it. Currently, I'm the vice president of Skipoli for season 16/17.</small></H4>

			<H4 style="font-size: 21px; padding-top: 2%;"><small>I love trips organized by other clubs as well as Skipolis trips, since I enjoy meeting new people who share my passion for snow. I have arranged several skiing trips myself, mostly within Finland but also a smaller trip to Austrian Alps as well. Some of these trips have had over 200 participants. In addition, I have been organizing various other events for Skipoli and events in cooperation with other academic skiing clubs.</small></H4>

			<H4 style="font-size: 21px; padding-top: 2%;"><small>Bouldering is the second of my two favorite sports. First I started with indoor top-rope, but I'm much more into bouldering nowadays. It is a very physical sport and also a very social one, despite of ultimately being an individual sport. You are never alone in a bouldering gym and the better will help you.</small></H4>

			<H4 style="font-size: 21px; padding-top:4%;"><small>Bouldering challenges you to surpass yourself every time with new problems. The bouldering routes are called problems, because bouldering actually includes a very mental side for the sport and you need to plan ahead before wasting your power. There might be a very clever trick to solve some problems, and the feeling you get from finally figuring it out is the best there is.</small></H4>
