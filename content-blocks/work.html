			<H3><small>I was a testing trainee within the product development of high power electric drives. The work mainly included electrical testing of the prototype products as well as some hands on tasks related to the testing. During my internship in this position I got an understanding of how big scale product development works in practise and how many different factors and tasks have to be included in product development processes.</small></H3>
