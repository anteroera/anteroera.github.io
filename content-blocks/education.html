			<H3><small>My major is in Automation and Systems Technology. I was very interested in the wide range of courses when I started my studies but remained on my original study path aiming at a major in Automation and Systems Technology, took a minor in Computer Science. My field of studies is very interesting as it comprises of studies related to some of the most interesting technologies, such as robotisation, internet-of-things and artificial intelligence. I also attended several courses outside my major and minor in order to broaden my knowledge and skills in various fields of technology.</small></H3>

			<H3><small>In 2015, I got the unique chance to attend the Stanford University for the summer in the Stanford Summer International Honors Program (<a href="https://summer.stanford.edu/programs/ihp/">SSIHP</a>). It is a program where students from all around the world are invited to experience the Stanford University and Silicon Valley with an international student community. At Stanford I studied courses with a focus around technological entrepreneurship. I learned important skills especially in working within international teams and environments as well as product development skills. My mindset was also strongly affected during this time and my way of thinking became more entrepreneurial, open minded and curious towards international matters.</small></H3>
